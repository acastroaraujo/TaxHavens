# Tax Havens

Traditional research on tax havens –and more broadly, the network of global corporate control– has focused too much on the properties of individual nodes and too little on the properties of individual edges. I propose to exploit the perceived inconsistencies of FDI data to shine a light on anomalous transactions between countries, rather than just trying to classify individual countries as tax havens or not.
